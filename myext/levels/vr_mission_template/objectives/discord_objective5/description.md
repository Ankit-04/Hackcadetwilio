# Final Objective

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The only thing left to do for the basic bot is to make it write messages back</li>
  <li>Once you have wrote the command so that the bot can say hello click <em>HACK</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Go back to the documentation and try to find how to send messages. This last task is fairly simple, but documentation can often be confusing to naviagte so dont be scared to look at the help tab.


Once you have found the entire command past it in and click the _HACK_ button.
